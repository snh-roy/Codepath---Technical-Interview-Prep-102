# Problem 1: Selective DNA Deletion
'''
As a biologist, you are working on editing a long strand of DNA represented as a linked list of nucleotides. 
Each nucleotide in the sequence is represented as a node in the linked list, where each node contains a character ('A', 'T', 'C', 'G') representing the nucleotide.
Given the head of the linked list dna_strand and two integers m and n, write a function edit_dna_sequence() that simulates the selective deletion of nucleotides in a DNA sequence. You will: - Start at the beginning of the DNA strand. - Retain the first m nucleotides from the current position. - Remove the next n nucleotides from the sequence. - Repeat the process until the end of the DNA strand is reached.
Return the head of the modified DNA sequence after removing the mentioned nucleotides.
Evaluate the time and space complexity of your solution. Define your variables and provide a rationale 
for why you believe your solution has the stated time and space complexity

# Problem 2: Protein Folding Loop Detection
'''
As a biochemist, you're studying the folding patterns of proteins, which are represented as a sequence of amino acids linked together. 
These proteins sometimes fold back on themselves, creating loops that can impact their function.
Given the head of a linked list protein where each node in the linked list represents an amino acid in the protein, return an array with the values of any cycle in the list. A linked list has a cycle if at some point in the list, the nodeâ€™s next pointer points back to a previous node in the list.
The values may be returned in any order.

# Problem 3: Segmenting Protein Chains for Analysis
'''
As a biochemist, you are analyzing a long protein chain represented by a singly linked list, where each node is an amino acid. 
For a specific experiment, you need to split this protein chain into k consecutive segments for separate analysis.
Each segment should be as equal in length as possible, with no two segments differing in size by more than one amino acid.
The segments should appear in the same order as the original protein chain, and segments earlier in the list should have a size greater 
than or equal to those occurring later. If the protein chain cannot be evenly divided, some segments may be an empty list.
Write a function split_protein_chain() that takes the head of the linked list protein and an integer k, and returns an array of k segments.
Evaluate the time and space complexity of your solution. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has 
the stated time and space complexity.
