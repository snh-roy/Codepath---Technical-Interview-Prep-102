#Problem 1: Croquembouche II
'''
You are designing a delicious croquembouche (a French dessert composed of a cone-shaped tower of cream puffs ðŸ˜‹), for a couple's wedding. 
They want the cream puffs to have a variety of flavors. You've finished your design and want to send it to the couple for review.
Given a root of a binary tree design where each node in the tree represents a cream puff in the croquembouche, 
traverse the croquembouche in tier order (i.e., level by level, left to right).
You should return a list of lists where each inner list represents a tier (level) of the croquembouche and the elements of each inner list contain the 
flavors of each cream puff on that tier (node vals from left to right).
Note: The build_tree() and print_tree() functions both use variations of a level order traversal. 
To get the most out of this problem, we recommend that you reference these functions as little as possible while implementing your solution.
Evaluate the time and space complexity of your function. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time and space complexity. 
Assume the input tree is balanced when calculating time complexity.

    The time complexity is O(n) because we visit each node once.
    The space complexity is O(n) because we store the nodes in a queue and the tiers in a list.

#Problem 2: Icing Cupcakes in Zigzag Order

'''
You have rows of cupcakes represented as a binary tree cupcakes where each node in the tree represents a cupcake. 
To ice them efficiently, you are icing cupcakes one row (level) at a time, in zig zag order (i.e., from left to right, then right to left for the next row and alternate between).
Return a list of the cupcake values in the order you iced them.
Evaluate the time and space complexity of your function. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you 
believe your solution has the stated time and space complexity. Assume the input tree is balanced when calculating time complexity.

#Problem 3: Larger Order Tree
'''
You have the root of a binary search tree orders, where each node in the tree represents an order and each node's value represents the number of cupcakes the customer ordered. 
Convert the tree to a 'larger order tree' such that the value of each node in tree is equal to its original value plus the sum of all node values greater than it.
As a reminder a BST satisfies the following constraints:
The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
Evaluate the time and space complexity of your function. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time and space complexity. Assume the input tree is balanced when calculating time complexity.
